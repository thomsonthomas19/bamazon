### About
This will run through how the current bamazon assignment should operate.
Upon running the JS file, all of the items available for purchase will be listed. 
The user will then be prompted to select the ID of one of the items, and will be asked how many they wish to buy.
If the quantity selected does not exceed current stock quantity, the order will be fulfilled and the user will be told how much money was spent total. The stock quantity amount will then be adjusted accordingly.
If too big of a quantity is selected, the user will receive a message explaining the order could not go through.
